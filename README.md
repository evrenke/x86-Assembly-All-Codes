# x86-Assembly-All-Codes
Assembly code to run to use visual studio.
This library has all of the assignments as well as some in-class code (worksheets) that I worked on during my X86 Assembly Processor Code class.

The code shown uses a library called "irvine", which has procedures for reading and writing input to the console, among other things.

Most of the code shown is from simple problems and assignments, but Assignment 8 was the final project and shows my current capability before further training.
