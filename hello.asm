Write a program that:
1.     Clears the screen, locates the cursor near the middle of the screen.
2.     Prompts the user for two signed integers.
3.     Displays their sum and difference.
4.     Repeats the same steps three times. Clears the screen after each loop iteration.
5.     You need to call the following procedures from irvine32 library:
        ClrScr
        WriteString
        WriteInt
        ReadInt
        Crlf
        ReadChar
        Gotoxy

The Gotoxy procedure locates the cursor at a given row and column in the console window.
By default, the console window뭩 X-coordinate range is 0 to 79 and the Y-coordinate range is 0 to 24.
When you call Gotoxy, pass the Y-coordinate (row) in DH and the X-coordinate (column) in DL. Sample call:

mov   dh,10 ; row 10
mov   dl,20 ; column 20
call  Gotoxy; locate cursor


6.     You need to create the following procedures:
        Locate. It needs to be called before anything displays on the screen. Where it sets the cursor position.         
		Input: this procedure prompts the user and saves the input.
		DisplaySum: calculates and displays the sum.
		DisplayDiff: calculates and displays the difference. (first input - the second input)
		WaitForKey; It needs to be called at the end of each iteration.
		It displays "Press any key..." and waits for an input
